# ATE Cosmere
The ATE Cosmere is a mature C# project that I architected and implemented as part of my career over the past couple of years (not publicly available for now unfortunately). However, this repository is a '[Rustification](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/)' of that project and in a way a fresh cleaner start. As I worked more and more with C# (and loved it) I couldn't help but miss the native support for Option and Result types. Moreover, C# performance did leave a bit to be desired especially when I started analyzing huge amount of data in memory. Moreover, I didn't really like the idea of a runtime that needs to be installed before my binaries could run using the latest .NET release. Even with the options of embedding the runtime, it felt quite bloated.
